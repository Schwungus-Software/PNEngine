# PNEngine

PNEngine is a fully external 3D engine for GameMaker with support for modding
and local multiplayer with up to 4 players.

In order to build this, you will need to import the extensions
[GMEXT-FMOD](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GMEXT-FMOD)
and [NekoPresence](https://github.com/nkrapivin/NekoPresence) to the project's
Extensions folder using the GameMaker IDE.

## Credits

PNEngine was created by **[Can't Sleep](https://cantsleep.cc)** and **[nonk](https://nonk.dev)**.

The curve shader is from **[Mors](https://mors-games.com/)**' [Super Mario 64 Plus Launcher](https://github.com/MorsGames/sm64plus-launcher).

A list of all of the used libraries can be found **[here](https://schwungus.software/docs/#/pnengine/summary?id=credits)**.
